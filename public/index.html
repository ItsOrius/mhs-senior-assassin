    <h1>MHS Senior Assassin</h1>
    <i>Hosted by Noah Maue</i>
    <h2>RULES</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Every participating player will be assigned a "target" in their emails.</li>
      <li>Players will attempt to squirt a water gun at their target to eliminate them.</li>
      <li>Players are also allowed to shoot their assassin, but they should be sure they're correct, because...</li>
      <li>If a player squirts a water gun at somebody who isn't their target or assassin, they must either resign or work to create a compromise with the other person.</li>
      <li>Once a player eliminates somebody else, they must report it WITH VIDEO EVIDENCE at https://marinercentral.net.</li>
      <li>Confirmed eliminations will be posted on Instagram (@mhs.24.seniorassassin) with names and photos (where applicable).</li>
      <li>MHS GROUNDS ARE A SAFE ZONE!  We shouldn't do anything that a faculty member will get upset about...</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The last person/people standing wins!<br>
      The winner(s), as well as the person with the most eliminations, will receive a small prize!
